## Getting Started

This guide provides recommendations for configuring and optimizing [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to enhance your coding experience. Each setting can be adjusted to suit your preferences and workflow.
These settings are part of the [Evondev](https://github.com/evondev/vscode-custom) custom configuration for Visual Studio Code, which includes additional features like tab customization and more.

We can see it in [vs-customization](/vscode-customization/)
